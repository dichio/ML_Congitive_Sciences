    "We consider $M$ **binary random patterns:** both inputs $x^{(m)} \\in \\{0, 1\\}^L$ and labels $y^{(m)} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ are drawn uniformly at random, with no correlation. Here, $L$ is the dimension of the input space (number of features) and $M$ is the number of patterns to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a perceptron learning problem with **loading parameter** $\\alpha = M/L$. For random binary patterns in the double infinite size limit $M, L \\to \\infty$ with fixed ratio $\\alpha = M/L$, the **critical capacity** is $\\alpha_c \\approx 2$. This means:\n",
    "- **$\\alpha < \\alpha_c$**: Random patterns are typically linearly separable $\\Rightarrow$ perceptron converges\n",
